# ez-intrin
I intend for this to be a wrapper over the basic intrinsics that various compilers provide, plus a wrapper over the common hardware capabilities that are not standard for c++. If they can add them into webassembly then I'd imagine they can be wrapped up quite nicely.
However this is nowhere near complete, and I'm not actively working on it.
